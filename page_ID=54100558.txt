From the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, a wardian case of 50 plants of (Manicoba) 
Ceara Rubber, said to be a superior variety, was received and these have been planted 
at Tasek Glugor Forest Reserve in Province Wellesley. 
6. Some new ferns and palms were added to the Garden collections from the 
Botanic Gardens, Singapore, and several flowering or decorative plants. The collection 
of Caladiums was enriched by some new choice varieties. From the German Consul 
at Padang the gigantic terrestrial aroid ( ' Amorphophallus Titanum) has been received. 
The collection of Cannas is large and includes many novelties and made a fine 
display during the latter months of the year. 
7. A sum of $129.24 has been expended in the purchase of plants and seeds. 
This is a very small amount compared with the receipts and it should be mentioned 
that it is not as easy now as formerly to obtain new plants, particularly novelties, by 
exchange, owing to the preference for temperate rather than tropical plants in home 
gardens. To obtain new varieties a small sum must be expended for which an assured 
return may be expected. New plants if novelties are much in demand.
