work and planting, experimental cultivation, and clearing land. 
The main drive has been kept in good repair by the Garden staff, and the 
entrance from the Batu Berendam Road has been raised so as to be above the water 
level during the rainy Season. 
3. An avenue of specimen local trees is being formed on the part of the drive 
which entirely belongs «to the Garden, and a specimen of Penaga, Petaling, Kayu 
Minyak, Bilian Wangei, Gombang, Kudang, Meranti and Seraya, has been planted 
during the year. ,

ment grounds, and for general distribution, has been maintained throughout the year.

8. All the available land suitable for experimental cultivation has been cultivated 
throughout the year. 
9. Egyptian cotton, annatto, tea and castor-oil, have been grown on the land 
adjoining the lake. 
10. Egyptian cotton ( Gossypium arboreum) gave a moderate crop, and a sample 
has been submitted to the. Director of Gardens and Forests for report. Cotton could, 
doubtless, be grown as a first crop on freshly clear.ed land, but the soil of the Settle- 
ment generally is not rich enough for its cultivation. 
11. Annatto ( Bixa orellana ) has grown well, and could be cultivated readily in 
almost any part of the Settlement. 
12. Hybrid Assam Tea ( Thea chinensis, var). — Tea has grown well, but is not 
yet old enough to experiment with. Towards the end of the year some havoc to the 
plants was done by white ants, frequent watering with Mauritius-hemp water had the 
effect of driving the ants away for some time. 
* 12,283 brought forward from previous year.
