FOREST DEPARTMENT, SINGAPORE. 
Area. * 
1. The total area of the forest reserves nowin Singapore is,* 14,509 acres 1 
rood and 8 poles. This gives a decrease of 7 acres t rood and 15 poles from that of 
last year, due to the sale of a piece of land in the Bedok district valueless for forest 
purposes. The land fetched the sum of 35- 
Boundaries. 
2. The boundaries have been well kept up and cleaned of grass and fern, and 
over the' stream and swamps the bridges have. been renewed. A large number of 
notice boards have been put up at salient points of the. reserves to warn persons 
against trespassing therein. The whole of the reserves are now correctly surveyed 
and demarcated. • . ■
