Coconut Trees Inspection, 
Notices were served on ninety-seven persons to clear away stumps, dead trees 
and rubbish and 2c 9 dead trees and 154 stumps and logs and 74 piles of rubbish 
likely to or containing beetles were destroyed. 
The number of dead trees is small showing the effects of legislation in 
exterminating the red beetle. All or almost all the destruction of palms was caused by 
the black beetle ; the red beetle is really nearly extinct, at least in Singapore. It will 
now be comparatively easy in future to guard the estates from any loss, though of 
course continued inspection will be necessary. The great and increasing importance 
of the coconut industry thoroughly justifies the care taken and the small expenditure 
employed in protecting the coconut trees bv inspection.
