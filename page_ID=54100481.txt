Experimental Nursery. 
15. It was decided in 1900 that this Nursery should be abandoned, it having 
been proved that the altitude is not sufficient for the cultivation of European fruits, 
and the sum of $300 was inserted in the Estimates for reafforesting the site. A good 
number of plants and seeds of the better class native timber trees, and some introduc- 
ed ones have been planted, but I have not deemed it necessary to spend all this 
money, as, with a little assistance, this spot, surrounded as it is with large seed beai- 
ing trees, is bound to recover itself in a natural manner. 
Coco-nuts. 
16. The cultivation of Coco-nuts is one of the most important and profitable indus- 
tries in this part of the world, and one in which perhaps a greater number of individuals 
are interested than in any other. A few Europeans in this Settlement own large 
plantations, and in the Native Malay States some have planted on a considerable 
scale, but on the whole it must be looked on mainly as a native proprietor s cropland 
in their interest it is important that the destructive beetles be kept in check. W hen 
1 first came to Penang -|ro-i 2 was about the price per 1,000 nuts and this was then con- 
sidered a paying price. In recent years the price has ranged from <§>25-3° with a ready 
market for any quantity. A large proportion of the Penang and Province Wellesley 
crop is shipped to Rangoon, where the product is used as food in the form of curries, 
sweetmeats, etc. Both in England and Germany Coco-nut butter is being manufac- 
tured on an extensive scale, but the low temperature at which it becomes liquid 
militates against it's introduction here. V - 
The Inspector of Coco-nut trees has been employed seven months in Province 
Wellesley and five months in Penang in inspecting plantations, Cow sheds, Stables 
and other places containing material forming suitable breeding places for the Coco- 
nut Beetle. The number of Notices served' trees destroyed and prosecutions under

Total. 
Weather. 
17. During the latter part of 1900, and the first three months of 1901, Penang 
experienced a period of unprecedented drought. During that time little garden work 
could be done beyond watering, and in spite of every care in this matter quite large 
trees and shrubs suffered severely. So prolonged was the drought that there was 
great danger of a water famine in the town, and auxiliary sources of supply had to 
be hurriedly extemporised in order to avert a calamity. At the time it was proposed 
by the Municipal Engineer to acquire the Waterfall Valley for the purpose of forming 
a reservoir in order to obviate the possibility of a similar occurrence. This would 
of course completely destroy the present Garden on which so much time and money 
has been spent, and would be a great misfortune, but should it become absolutely 
necessary in the future to carry out this scheme a new site in the direction of Ayer 
Etam near the starting point of the proposed Hill Railway would be the most suitable 
place "for the formation of a new Garden.
