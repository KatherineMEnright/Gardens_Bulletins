It is naturally difficult at first to see the effects of legislation in this matter, but 
there is little doubt but that the disease has received a check which could not other- 
wise have been brought about. In the Botanic Gardens, notably at one spot near 
the office, it was almost impossible to grow any palms at all. Those liable to attack 
were destroyed often within a day or two of their being planted; a small avenue of 
the rare and beautiful Verschaffeltia splendida by the aviary was perishing tree 
by tree, till the Act came into force. A large plantation near the Gardens, 
but not visible from it, together with a small number of trees in the Barrack- 
grounds, was cleaned, and the decaying trees removed, and the destruction 
rapidly c^minished. At the end of the year, many of the palms which had been 
attacked were no longer subject to the injuries by the beetles, and now it is rare to 
find any among the palms. I may mention, as showing the futility of merely trusting 
to coolies employed on a. plantation as beetle-killers, that on the plantation which did 
so much damage to the Botanic Gardens, there were two, and sometimes three coolies 
employed only in keeping the trees clean of beetles, yet it was in as bad a state as • 
almost any neglected one in Singapore. 
In looking over the whole results of the passing of the Ordinance, I believe that 
a very large amount of benefit has accrued to the Colony at a very small cost and 
without any friction.
