Economic Gardens. 
I 
A considerable portion of ground covered with scrub lying adjacent to the Bukit 
4 imali Road was cleared and planted with Para Rubber stumps and seedlings which 
have thriven well. 'I he Merabau trees in the remaining portion of the scrub were 
cleared round and the ground opened up. A band of scrub was cleared along the 
Eastern boundary of the Garden for planting Castilloa as it seemed the most suitable 
spot tor it. A number of cuttings of Ficus elastica were planted in various spots, for 
experiment, many trees were added to the arboretum. Among the Economic plants 
received during the year were — Pachylobus ednlis from Calabar, Coffez Laurentii- 
robusta, 7 heobroma pentagona , Landolphia klainei, and L. Owariensis from Kevv ; 
hickxia elastica , of which three lots of seeds were received from different contributors, 
but unfortunately none germinated. This is the tree which produces the Kickxia Rubber 
of Africa and not the K. Africana which was previously distributed from Europe. 
The large fruited bamboo Melocanna bambusoides was sent by the Chittagong 
Forest Department.
