20. The Mandor SAMUEL having been dismissed a man of the name of ROGERS 
was employed and gave great satisfaction. The coolies worked well, and the grounds 
were kept in an excellent condition. The plant-houses were put in thorough repair, 
and a number of small trees were planted in spots where it was considered advisable 
to block out houses, or unsightly spots. During his visit to Singapore, PRINCE-HENRY 
of Prussia planted a palm ( Oreodoxa oleracea) on the lawn in front of the house.

Waterfall Garden. 
In addition to the usual routine work of maintaining a public Garden in good 
order, considerable progress has been made in extending the area and developing 
the natural features of the grounds. 
2. Outside the plant nursery a steep bank has been sloped, turfed, and the 
upper portion planted with ornamental flowering shrubs; and a further portion of the 
banks of the stream which intersects the garden has also been sloped and turfed. 
3. Above the Office a new clearing has been made, one hundred and eighty feet 
broad, and extending up the hillside for a distance of two hundred and fifty feet, the 
whole sloped and turfed. On this land the best of the original trees have been left 
and where necessary others of an ornamental nature planted. 
4. A carriage road seventeen feet wide has been made, and metalled, around 
the Band Stand where there was previously only a five foot path. It is not often the 
band plays in this garden as it is considered to be too far from town, but wdienever 
it has done so some inconvenience has been experienced for want of room in which 
to draw up carriages. This has now been remedied.
