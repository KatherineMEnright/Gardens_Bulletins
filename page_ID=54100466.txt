Forests. 
21. - In February I visited the Din ding's to inspect some proposed additions to 
the Forest Reserves in that District on which I reported on my return and of which 
I attach a copy (Appendix B). 
Visits were also made at the request of District Officer to Tassek Glugor and 
Bukit Panchor Reserves, Province Wellesley. 
22. In accordance with instructions from His Honour the Acting Governor, I 
went to Malacca in May with five hundred plants of fi Gutta Taban ” (Dichopsis Gutta 
or D. oblongifolia) and selected two sites on which to plant them. These trees were 
planted out 2o' x 20' in partial shade, the idea being to gradually cut away the surround- 
ing “ bluker ” as the plantsacquire strength. While these enquiries were made and 
samples collected of some of the local climbing rubbers, which together with leaf 
specimens were sent to Kew, and a report on these has already been published in the 
Government Gazette . The Forest tree Nursery at Ayer Kroh was also inspected 
and at the request of the Acting Resident Councillor a few simple instructions in 
writing drawn up for the guidance of the Overseer in charge. 
23. From June the 18th to July 2nd, I was detailed to accompany Mr. H. C. 
Hill of the Indian Forest Department during his tour of inspection of the Forests of 
the Colony in Penang, Province Wellesley and the Dindings. Mr. Hill has since 
reported on these Forests and the manner in which they should in future be adminis- 
tered. 
24. In September, 1 'obtained permission to visit Perak for three days to make 
some enquiries and observations in connection with Gutta Perrha, especially the hill 
forms. On my return I furnished a short report on this trip, a copy of which is 
attached (Appendix C). 
Para Rubber. 
25. In my last two Annual Reports I have furnished information as regads the 
method adopted and results obtained from tapping a single Para Rubber tree (Hevea 
brasiliensis) growing in the Waterfall Garden, and the matter is of so great importance 
to the Agricultural Community of the Colony and Native States that no apology is 
necessary for again referring to the subject and repeating to a certain extent what 
has already been recorded in these reports. The tapping of this one tree has now 
been continued over a period of two years and the result is such as to confirm the 
opinion that in this cultivation lies a source of wealth of the greatest importance. 
This particular tree is now fifteen years old and has yielded in two years twelve and 
a half pounds of dry marketable rubber without any apparent injurious result to the health 
of the tree. It is growing on a dry t gravelly bank, not at all the sort of place I should 
select from choice, and is fifty-five feet high. At three feet from the ground it is sixty-six
