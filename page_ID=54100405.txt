in the act) be hard to ascertain the origin of these Fires, but they are variously attri- 
buted to the negligence of road coolies or ordinary foot passengers (who smoke and 
drop matches, etc. about), to the desire of local shikaries and cattle-owners to provide 
food (fresh lalang sprouts and young grass) for the animals in which they are inter- 
ested, and to the carelessness of coolies engaged in burning jungle or refuse with 
the wind blowing (and taking sparks with it) direct towards the Reserves. 
7. The Collector himself paid 21 visits to the reserves during the year. The 
paths were in good order and no traces of illicit cutting were observed. 
8. In the earlier paragraphs 1 of this report I wrote somewhat disparagingly of 
the value of these Reserves. They will however eventually — when the Singapore- 
Kranji Railway is built — save Government from expending in the purchase of wood 
fuel very considerable sums. The large expanses of Bakau at Kranji, Morai, Tuas, 
Pandan and Seletar should, if the unreserved Bakau fails, prove with judicious manage- 
ment practically inexhaustible. 
9. I did not take charge of the Land Office, Singapore, till the last day of 1898, 
and it is therefore with some diffidence that I sign this report dealing with the condi- 
tion of the Reserves in a year when I had so little official connection with them;
