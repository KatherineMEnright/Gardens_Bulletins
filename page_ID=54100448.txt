4- The approach to the granite bridge built in 1898 has been raised and metalled. 
Three hundred and nine feet of side drains built in rough masonry, and other minor 
improvements to roads carried out. 
5. The large iron plant shed near the entrance has been re-covered with “Chicks' 
and continues to be one of the most interesting features of the Garden. Many of the 
local tree ferns and other plants have attained a large size and an appearance such as 
is seldom seen when grown in pots. 
6. As in previous years, Cannas have been an important feature among flower- 
ing plants. All the beds were replanted and heavily manured in April and have been 
in continuous flower right through the wet weather when most other flowers are 
scarce. 
7. A large batch of Convolvulus grown in pots were very attractive during the 
early part of the year owing to their great range of colour. The seeds were obtained 
from Japan and said to be seeds of double forms, but the nearest approach were a few 
indifferent semi-doubles of no great merit. The single flowers were however very 
beautiful. 
8. On my way home in May, 1 took advantage of the boat remaining two days 
in Colombo to visit the Peradeniya Gardens and made notes of several things which 
we hope to receive from there later on. 
9. On my return from leave in November, 1 brought out a large collection of 
econpinic and ornamental plants, principally from the Royal Gardens, Kew, Messrs. 
F. Sander & Co., and Messrs. Jas. Veitch & Sons ; to all of whom the thanks of 
this department is due for their great liberality. Nearly all these plants, and also 
two Wards cases of plants handed to my care bv the Director, Kew, for the Singapore 
Gardens, arrived in excellent condition scarcely a plant being dead. Among the 
valuable plants from Kew are six plants of African rubber (Kickxia Africana) all of 
which are growing. Messrs. Sander & Co. contributed a fine lot of Cattleyas, 
Begonia, &c., and Messrs. VEITCH & Sons, Ferns^ Palms, &c. 
10. The usual interchange of plants and seeds has been carried on with 
Botanical and Horticultural Establishments and private individuals to about the same 
extent as in previous years, and plants sold to the value of $883.17 which is an 
increase of $187.77 on the previous year. 
1 1. The total expenditure of this garden amounted to $4,482.86, details of which, 
together with expenditure of other votes, is given in Appendix A annexed. 
Governor’s Hill Bungalow Garden, 
12. During the latter part of the year Air. O’Keefe, Overseer in charge, was on 
leave and his duties were satisfactorily performed by Sergeant WELLS. The usual 
supply of Vegetables and Flowers were maintained and the grounds kept in fairly 
good order. During January and February there was a fine show of Annuals, Phlox, 
and Dianthus having clone remarkably well. Dendrobium Fytehianum planted on 
the trees flowered very freely and was much admired. 
13. As is always the case here a large proportion of the labour was required in 
^repairing damage done by heavy rains. I give below the rainfall registered at this 
^station during the year.

Experimental Nursery. 
14. Nothing requiring special mention has been done in this Nursery. Two 
men only are employed to keep the weeds down and a portion of their time is devoted 
to keeping in order the grounds of Belle Vue Bungalow.
