Inspection of Coco-nut Trees. 
22. l ife yood effect accruing from constant inspection of coco-nut estates, 
tanneries and saw mills, is shewn by the fact that a Palm beetle is now very rarely 
seen, while very few years ago the beetles and their larvae could be seen by the 
thousand. During the year notices were served on 253 persons calling on them to 
destroy old coco-nut stumps, piles of rubbish, etc., and in every case were readily com- 
plied with, so that there was not a single prosecution. In all there were destroyed 
835 old trees, 121 stumps and 32 piles of rubbish.

Economic Gardens. 
23. The ground opened up in 1900 for planting the Central American Rubber 
(Castilloa elastica) was planted early in the year. The growth of the plants has been 
somewhat irregular, owing probably to some parts being wetter than others ; unlike 
Para Rubber, these plants do not seem to like low damp ground, as those on the 
drier parts have made the best growth. 
24. Para Rubber. — Our trees are still the principal stock plants for the supply of 
seed, the demand for which was about the same as last year. 1 anticipate however in 
the near future a much smaller demand, as many of the oldest trees on Mr. Bailey's 
Estate have begun to fruit. It is satisfactory to record that the Chinese squatters are 
turning their attention to this cultivation. One hundred and fifty-two thousand seeds, 
and nine thousand nine hundred and seventy-five plants were distributed as shewn in 
the subjoined table, which gives the quantity distributed during the past six years: —

25. The usual stock of young Economic plants was maintained by propagation 
from seed and cuttings. Blanks were filled up in the arboretum, and in the section 
plots. With the exception of one demand for 1,200 plants for Cochin China not a 
single enquiry was made for Ramie.
