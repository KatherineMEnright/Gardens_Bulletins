25M March , 1909. 
HENRY N. RIDLEY, 
Director of Gardens , S. S. 
Annual Report on the Botanic Gardens, Penang, 1908. 
Staff. 
1. Mr. Derry was in charge till the end of January when I came up from 
Singapore on the return from leave of Mr. Ridley, and resumed my substantive 
appointment. The only other change was necessitated by the breakdown of the 
Clerk, Mr. Aeria, who was more or less ill for some months ; he took leave for six 
weeks and was temporarily replaced by Mr. INGRAM. 
The health of the coolies has been fairly good, with perhaps fewer cases of Fever 
and Diarrhoea than usual. Several cases of Beri-beri occurred. 
Weather. 
2. The year under review has been a very wet one. The rainfall returns show 
that over 1 1 1 inches fell on the plain and 17 1 inches on the Hill against 1 24 inches on the 
Hill last year and 70 inches on the plain. September was the wettest month and January 
the driest. Appended are the Returns for the year. On the 26th of September was 
experienced the most destructive storm for many years past. The roads were blocked 
in many places owing to the numbers of trees blown down, four large trees were blown 
down in the Gardens which is comparatively sheltered. The fallen trees included a fine 
Norfolk Island pine over 70 feet tall. On the same date no less than eight inches of rain 
fell. The effect of the heavy rains on our hilly roads entailed an unusual amount of 
labour in keeping them in repair, and in many cases the entire labour staff did nothing 
else for days but repair the roads, so great was the scouring. 
The Yearâ€™s Work. 
3. Naturally after my long absence (nearly two years) I found some arrears of 
work ; much credit is due, however, to Mr. Derry who worked hard in bringing the 
Gardens back to efficiency after they had been without a Superintendent for a year,
