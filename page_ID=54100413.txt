individual who, under the circumstances, might decline to recognize it. In view of 
the fact that nearly 70 per cent, of the total revenue of the Dindings (apart from 
licences) is derived from its forests, it seems neither politic nor reasonable to stint 
the Department in such matters as these which, though they call for a most moderate 
outlay, are yet indispensable to the proper organization of forest conservancy. 
The timber revenue here has more than trebled during the last four years, the 
figures being as follows :■ —

The Tanjong Burong Firewood Farm, which had been closed in 1897 in conse- 
quence of the Farmer persisting in cutting down trees of a diameter less than that 
permitted by his Agreement, was re-let early in the year to a new holder under much 
stricter conditions than before. Under the previous contract, the rent was $60 pei 
month and the Farmer might employ 100 coolies; the present contract fixes the 
monthly rent at $80 and reduces the number of coolies to 60, the minimum diameter, 
of the trees which it is now permitted to cut is 8 inches. 
The contract expires at the end of 1899, and I understand that it is not the in- 
tention of Government to renew it.

In addition to the above, numerous casual visits were paid to every Reserve, 
except Gunong Tunggal, the isolated position of which makes it very difficult of 
access* 
A shelter-hut was built for the Guards at Sungei Panchor in September, and a 
sampan has also been provided for use in the same locality.
