Report on the Forest Reserves in the Seltlement 
of Malacca, for the year 1898, 
Resident Councillor’s Office, 
Malacca , 26th June , i8gg. 
SIR, — I have the honour to forward herewith the reports of the Collector of Land 
Revenue and the District Officers at Alor Gajah and Jasin, on the Forest Reserves of 
their District during 1898. 
2. The two chief events of the year as affecting the Reserves were : — 
(i) The closing of the Reserves by direction of His Honour the Officer Adminis- 
tering the Government on 8th August. 
(ii) 1'he enlargement of the Bukit Bruang Reserve by 2,715 acres. 
3. Prior to the closing order permits to cut timber were issued to the Public 
Works Department, Government Contractors and others. The permits issued to the 
Public Works Department were for timber required for Government buildings, repair 
of bridges, etc., and were granted free. Other recipients of passes paid tenths of the 
value of the timber. The trees were cut under the supervision of the District Offi- 
cers. The system was initiated and carried on by the Forest Department until its 
abolition in 1894. 
4. The enlargement of the Bukit Bruang Reserve is a very good thing. The 
additional land consists of small scrub and lalang but' will soon be covered with trees 
if carefully guarded from fires. The whole of this reserve is within easy reach of the 
town and any good descriptions of timber in it will therefore always be of consider- 
able value. * 
An increase in the staff of Forest Guards was asked for during the year in 
order to more efficiently preserve the reserves from illicit cutting. It was decided 
that the present establishment was adequate for the purpose. 
6. A small vote was however granted, for the present year, for the establish- 
ment of a nursery of forest trees. This is to be situated in the Bukit Bruang Reserve 
under the control of the Collector of Land Revenue and the special supervision of the 
Resident Councillor. It should be possible in a few years to plant up a large area of 
this reserve with valuable timber for the use of future generations. The reserve now 
contains a number of trees fit for felling and it would, in my opinion, be well if in this 
and the other reserves, a certain amount of timber were allowed to be felled for the 
use of Government and others. 
7. My annual administration report, paragraphs 253 to 264, a copy of which is 
attached, deals with Forest Reserve matters. 
8. I enclose a map of the Settlement showing the reserves as they existed prior 
to the appointment of Mr. CantleY as Superintendent, as they were then reformed 
in 1883-1888 and as they are now. 
The areas at the three periods are : —
