and the Province again scored heavily taking one silver cup won by Low Chit Mun, 
Balik Pulau, for best collection of cultivated fruits, 53 1st prizes, 43 2nd prizes, 20 3rd 
prizes, 8 silver and 3 bronze medals ; the amount of money prizes won by the Penang 
Contingent was $364. The classes in which Penang won easily were as usual spices, 
fruits, and oil. By the kindness of the Hon’ble Resident Councillor and on the 
invitation of Dr/ BUSSY, the Honorary Secretary of the Agricultural Division, I 
attended the Grand Industrial and Agricultural Show held in Deli at the end of 
August and beginning of September. As I have submitted to Government a special 
Report on my visit, it is only necessary to say here that I gained considerable 
instruction from my visit. 
Angsenna Trees Disease. 
13. For the past two years an obscure disease has been attacking the Angsenna 
trees along the road sides. These trees are quite a feature of Penang and whether 
covered with golden bloom, or out of flower with their graceful foliage, are alike of 
conspicuous beauty. Any serious damage to them is of the greatest importance ; up 
to the present over 50 large trees have succumbed to this disease, attempts have been 
made to check it by digging trenches round affected trees, and treating with sulphate 
of copper and lime. On my representation the Municipal Commissioners arranged for 
Mr. Gallagher, the Government Mycologist of the Federated Malay States, to visit 
Penang and report on them ; I showed him the attacked trees, and gave him a history 
of the cases and together we examined the roots. Mr. GALLAGHER has succeeded in 
finding the hyphoe of a fungus in the cell tissue from which he is trying to make 
cultures. He has submitted a preliminary Report, but, until his investigations are 
complete, it will be necessary to wait for his recommendations for the eradication of the 
disease. It is surmised that this is the same disease that carried off the magnificent 
Avenue of the same tree which adorned the sea shore in Malacca some 30 years ago.
