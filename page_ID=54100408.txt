9. The Revenue is of course nil, as all cutting is now absolutely prohibited, and 
there have been no planting operations. 
10. I inspected the different parts of the boundaries on the following dates, 
besides paying numerous visits to other parts of the Reserves : — • 
Penara Bukit Reserve. 
Upper Half, March 19th, June 18th and 24th. 
Lower Half, October 25th. 
Government Hill Reserve. 
From Penara Bukit to Half-Way House. November 3rd and 15th. 
Half-Way House to Tanjong Bunga. December 6th.

Batu Itam to Penara Bukit. December 30th. 
Highlands Reserve boundary. May 13th. 
n. A new Reserve on the tops of the Relau Hills has been created during the 
year. The boundaries of this block have not been opened yet, as the vote would not 
have stood the extra expense last year, but they will be taken in hand as soon as 
possible.
