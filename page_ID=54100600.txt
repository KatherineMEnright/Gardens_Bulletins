rr -Altogether 837,599 Para seeds were distributed. Of these 372,500 were garden seeds

Seeds consigned outside Malaya are packed in special tins locally made, each tin 
is capable of containing 600 seeds and with the packing material (padi arang) rice husk 
burnt to charcoal, comes under the 11 lb. limit of parcel postage. Seeds are placed in 
the tins, one by one, in 12 layers of 50 each and the rice charcoal is carefully filled in 
so that the 600 seeds, in effect, lie in compartments. The tins are then stitched in 
canvas coverings on which the address is hand-printed and declaration form affixed. In 
this way after an interval of ten weeks, good results have been obtained varying from 
50 to 90 % of germination. 
It will be, however, apparent that the work involved is considerable. Out of the 
seeds there were 1,055 parcels posted (mostly distributed via> Brindisi) containing 
€03,000 seeds; 262 parcels or 157,000 seeds consigned by freight and 77,400 seeds 
packed in boxes for despatch by coasting steamers. 
The sale of Para seedlings only reached 5,000 plants. 
Rubber Experiments. 
Tapping different group of trees was continued throughout the year except on 
very wet days, but owing to loss of trees through floods it may be necessary to re- 
arrange the groups on a new basis. 
During the year 2,326 lbs. of sheet and biscuit were prepared, making a total of 
3,230 lbs. all grades including scrap, old and new. Sales amounted to 2,415 lbs. 
realizing $4,919.51. The rubber obtained is slightly in excess of previous years, but 
the value is slightly less due to the fall in price of raw rubber. Small quantities of 
rubber and some latex were as usual supplied for analytical purposes. 
Goodwood Estate. 
Considering the disadvantage of situation Para trees have grown well on Good- 
wood Estate and the seven-acre block was maintained in good order up to the end of 
October. Since then weeds are rife, but with fair weather this will be remedied. 
It should be remarked that, there is very little fall in the drains, and during very wet 
weather the flooded ground is unworkable. 
Mount Zion Plantation. 
A fire occurred on this coconut block and did slight damage. The trees destroyed 
have been replaced and all are now growing fairly well. 
Penang Gardens. 
The scheme for converting the Penang Gardens into a reservoir having fallen 
through, the Gardens have been, it is understood, re-transferred to the Government. It
