with young trees and if the present system of reserve belts round large holdings is 
strictly maintained, all abandoned lands should quickly revert to forest. This rewood- 
ing by nature of abandoned lands may be seen going on all over the Settlement 
except in those localities where long stretches of lalang, unbroken by any belts of 
timber, have been allowed to become established. These are perpetuated, and only 
perpetuated, by the continual recurrence of fires, some caused by the careless light- 
ing of roadside fires, by cart-men cooking their meals but too often by deliberate firing 
in order that the young lalang springing up afterwards may form a grazing ground 
for cattle. Such wanton mischief almost always escapes unpunished, it being ap- 
parently beyond the powers of Police or Forest Officers to detect the offenders in the 
sparsely populated districts where they occur. 
* p t j an d 2 io. Attached to this report will be found extracts from previous reports giving 
and 4 to i2. information concerning the various reserves, the trees they contain, planting done in 
them and other matters which I have thought it may be convenient to collect and 
re-publish. I propose during the present year to endeavour to locate the plantations 
made prior to the abolition of the Forest Department and where the trees are found 
to have survived to have the plantations surveyed and a register compiled of them. 
ii. I hope that in the near future the Forest Department, abolished on the re- 
commendations of the Retrenchment Committee of 1893, may be re-established and 
placed under a responsible Officer. The Officer required however is a Forest Officer 
pure and simple for the conservation and improvement of the Forest Reserves * * *
