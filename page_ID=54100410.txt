prise visits to the Reserves in the South of the island, but are engaged most of their 
time in the neighbourhood of Telok Bahang. The greater part of the remaining 
Crown Land lies in this direction, and the time of one of the Forest Guards is almost 
entirely occupied in inspecting passes for wood-cutting on Crown Land and in ex- 
amining the wood cut, to make sure that it is not in excess of that provided /or in 
the pass. I fear that the new Reserve on Balik Pulau Hills will still further occupy 
their time in clearing, and that they will thus have less leisure than before for what 
is their proper duty, i.e. } patrolling and guarding the Reserves. If more coolies could 
be engaged for the necessary work of clearing the paths, the Forest Guards would 
be able to devote themselves exclusively to patrolling the Reserves. Unfortunately, 
however, there is no money available for the engagement of other coolies, and the 
Forest Guards have to do both duties as best they can. I think that at least one 
extra coolie should be employed for clearing the Forest Reserve boundaries in 1899.

Northern District, P. W. 
1. There are two Forest Reserves in this District, one at Tassek Glugor and the 
other at Ara. Kuda, the former is 3,055 acres in extent, and the latter 562 acres. 
2. I took over the duties of Senior District Officer only at the end of November, 
so that 1 have not had time except just to visit them, but the Forest Ranger has visited 
them on an average about once a week, and there is one Forest Guard who lives close 
at hand and looks after both of them. 
v- — 3. Two lalang fires took place in Tassek Glugor Reserve during the year but no 
f ytaiber was burnt. The fires are supposed to have originated by passers along the 
' road by the Reserve carelessly throwing away matches, but no one was caught. No 
fire took place in the Ara Kuda Reserve. 
4. There are very few valuable timber trees in the Reserves and no planting 
has been attempted.
