To 
The Hon’ble the Resident Councillor. 
Sir, — : In accordance with instructions in Circular Departmental, No. ig, dated 
1st August, 1894, 1 have the honour to submit, for the information of His Excellency 
the Governor, the following Report on a recent trip to Perak for the purpose of collect- 
ing botanical specimens for the Herbarium, for cultivation in the Garden, and for 
exchange. 
2. Left Penang by tlie s.s. Taw Tong , at 3 P.M. on the 15th instant, and arrived 
at Telok Anson at 6 A.M. the following morning; at 2 P.M. proceeded to Tapah Road 
Station by rail, and arrived there at 3 P.M. From Tapah Road Station to Tapah is an 
hour’s drive by gharry, but, owing to detention, it was 5 P.M. when I reached the Town. 
3. The following morning, Ocrober 17th, commenced work by collecting along a 
bridle-path in the direction of a place called Kalindi for a distance of about four or 
five miles. The afternoon, and in fact all the afternoons during my stay, turned out 
very wet, and little collecting could be done. There are many interesting plants in 
this locality, especially palms, of which J procured seeds of several species. It is also 
a good agricultural country, suitable for many tropical products, particularly Liberian 
coffee, of which there are promising plantations in the neigbourhood of Tapah.
