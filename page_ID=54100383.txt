Exchanges . 
The following exchanges of plants and seeds have taken place during the year. 
’Five hundred and seventy-seven plants and four hundred and twenty -seven packets 
of seed. The former comprises a set of the new and beautiful begonias of the Rex type, 
selected by Mr. Fox and presented by Messrs. Sander & Co. The same firm also 
presented a series of new caladiums and seven plants of that most beautiful African 
genus Streptocarpus. It is hoped that by hybridization between this genus and our 
own, nearly allied, one of Didymocarpus, we shall succeed in imparting a vigour to the 
latter which will enable it to be grown freely on the plains. 
Two hundred and fifty-three plants and forty-one packages of seeds were sent 
out to various Botanic Gardens.
