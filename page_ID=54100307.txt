Fishing-stakes are cut of various sizes and are sold according to size. A stake 
nine fathoms long sells for 35 cents, and six fathoms long 25 cents, that is $250 to $350 
per thousand. The license to cut these costs $40, so that the profit is fairly 
large, but it irfust be remembered that the expenses of bringing the stakes to the 
village are often very great. The stakes are usually brought down by raft, and from 
Sungei Bufoh, where a license was issued this year, to Telok Blanga it takes ten days 
to bring them down. One headman and six others can cut 1,000 rollers in a month. 
Each cuts for himself, and pays a commission of a dollar to the headman, who is res- 
ponsible to the Towkay for the 1,000 stakes, the Towkay advancing the money for 
the license, and pays the cutters according to the agreement, viz., 35 cents for'9 
fathoms, and 25 for 6 or 7 fathoms. The Towkay sells them again to the fishing 
stake owners, at a higher price, viz., 45 cents for nine fathoms and 35 cents for 6 to 7 
fathoms. In this way he makes a very considerable profit, and as he pays for the 
license the increased charge affects him only and does not affect the hard-working 
cutter. 
Bakau bark generally used for tanning in Singapore, is not at present procured 
from the Forest Reserves, as the Malays bring it from the Peninsula in large boats or 
tongkangs. It is sold by the cart-load, at 813.50 per cart. The barks used are 
Blukup, Tumu and Akit, and also Pagar Anak ( 1 xonanthes icosandra ), which is 
not a mangrove tree. 
Besides- the above-mentioned trees, the following contribute to the formation 
of the mangrove forests : — 
Nirek ( Carapa nioluccana ), a very hard timber, but large trees are almost 
invariably hollow internally. The bark has a reputation as a medicine for dysentery. 
Tengar ( Ceriops Candolleana). 
Busing ( Bruguiera caryophylloides ) also called Bakau Puteh. 
Lenggadi {B. parviflora , Wt.). 
(. B . eriopetala). 
Teremtam ( Lumnitzera coccinea ), good timber. 
Stada ( Podocarpus nerii folia, Don.).
