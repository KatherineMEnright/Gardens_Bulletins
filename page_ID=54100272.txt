Tuba (Derr is scandens) is stated to destroy lalang if planted among it, but I have had 
no opportunity of verifying it. Fourcroya gigantea will also grow among and destroy 
the lalang to a certain extent. Fagroeaperegrina, as mentioned previously, is also 
a success. Besides which, I hope to try the purple Jatropha and some species 
of Erythrina. 
Of course, it will be understood that in any case the process will be a slow one, and 
it will be along time before the injury caused by the early destruction of the forests 
throughout the Colony is healed, but we may hope that as years go on it may be 
found possible to work more rapidly.
