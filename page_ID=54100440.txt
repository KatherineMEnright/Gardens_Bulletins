Annual Report of the Botanic Gardens, Singapore. 
Staff. 
i. Mr. Curtis, Assistant Superintendent of the Penang Botanic Gardens, having 
gone home on leave in May ist, it was necessary to send Mr. Fox to Penang to act for 
him during his absence. He left for Penang in April 26th and returned November 6th. 
The plant-collector, TALKA, left early in the year and was replaced by a Malay KASDANI. 
The apprentice Simon left at the same time. The coco-nut trees inspection coolie 
Packay, who had been employed for ten years, died of small-pox, and was replaced by 
a Malay, and an extra coolie was employed for part of the year in cutting down dead 
anjj dying trees on abandoned coco-nut estates. The coolies worked well and there 
was no difficulty in obtaining as many as were required. The beri-beri which had been 
troublesome among them for the past two or three years entirely disappeared on the 
destruction of the old cooly lines and there was hardly any sickness of any kind 
among them after the new lines were built. 
Visitors. 
2. The number of visitors was as large as usual, and a good number of scientific 
botanists, planters and others interested in botany visited the gardens. The Regi- 
mental band played on moonlight nights and was much appreciated. There were 
but few thefts and those of a very petty nature and there were no prosecutions.

field in the Town Hall in April. The display of flowers and especially orchids was 
much finer than on any previous occasion.
