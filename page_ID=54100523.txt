from Malakoff and Caledonia Estates where it has been tried corroborate our own 
experiments. As regards Sea Island Cotton the extensive trial at Golden Grove 
Estate is not yet complete so that a final judgment on that variety must be deferred 
to the next report. 
Coco-nut Trees Preservation. 
9. The number of notices issued during the year in Penang and Province 
Wellesley was 650. There were 5 prosecutions in Penang with 4 convictions. In 
Province Wellesley there were 19 prosecutions and 17 convictions. The fines realised 
being $66.50, a very small sum which is I fear not sufficiently deterrent. The 
Inspector reports that the districts from Bagan Tuan Kechil as far as Ara Rendang, 
and from Bukit Tengah to Bukit Mertajam were towards the close of the year badly 
infested with beetles. The following table summarizes the work done during the year, 
the expenditure being shewn in Appendix C. 
The Royal Horticultural Show. 
10. In response to a notice of the Royal Horticultural Society of England which 
was published in the Gazette , that an exhibition of Colonial Fruits, either |resh or 
preserved in Syrups or tins, etc., would be held in London in December last, I got 
together with the permission of Government a small collection of 26 kinds of our local 
fruits and vegetables which the natives use as sweetmeats. The Secretary of the 
Royal Horticultural Society, the Rev. W. WlLKS, M.A., informs me in a letter: 
“ The fruits attracted considerable attention and the Council have awarded them a 
Silver Banksian Medal. ” This is distinctly encouraging and shews the possibility of 
a trade industry being opened up with the mother country when the small land-owner has 
been educated up to a knowledge of the advantages to be derived from fruit cultivation. 
Agricultural Show. 
1 1 . The first of the new series of annual Agricultural Shows was held in Kuala 
Lumpur in August and was a complete success. As full reports have appeared in the 
Bulletin and the Press it is unnecessary to allude to it further than to say that Penang 
came in for a share of the prizes. The nutmegs and cloves were particularly fine and 
were easily first. 
Expenditure. 
12. The total amount of Government Grants under the heading of Botanic Gardens 
amounted to $7,510, of which $7,374.43 was expended, particulars of which are given 
in Appendix C.
