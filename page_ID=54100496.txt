y. The recipients were about equal in number to contributors and to a great 
extent the same individuals, but there are others, of which the Curator of the Botanic 
Station Seychelles, and H. H. the Rajah Muda of Kedah received the largest collec- 
tions. Plants of Kickxia (Funtumia) elastica raised from seeds obtained direct 
from West Africa by the Superintendent of Go\ eminent Plantations Selangor were 
divided between the Superintendents cf Government Plantations Perak and Selan- 
gor, a few given to private planters, and some planted in Penang in the Forest 
Reserve at Batu Feringgi. 
8. Plants to the value of $>741 were sold, the greater proportion being orna- 
mental plants in pots; but included some 3,000 rubber plants of sorts. The greatest 
demand in the way of decorative plants is for Palms, the taste for which has greatly 
extended during recent years. The increase in revenue over the previous year’s 
collection amounts to $167. 
9. Drawings of many new and interesting plants that have flowered in the 
garden have been added during the year, and it is hoped that more work of this kind 
will be done in the future as the Artist's time has hitherto been largely taken up with 
typewriting and other clerical work for which a man is provided in Estimates 1903. 
10. Numerous additions have been made to the herbarium, which although con- 
fined exclusively to Malayan plants, has outgrown the accommodation provided. New 
Cabinets have been purchased but a larger and more suitable building is much needed. 
Governor’s Hill Bungalow Gardens. 
11. This garden suffered much during the early part of the year from want of 
water. The rain-water tanks were all dry and the pump out of order. All the men 
employed could only carry enough water to keep the pot plants alive, and in many 
cases failed to do even that. Until there is some more satisfactory arrangement for 
supplying water it will not be possible to do much more in the way of growing choice 
plants here than is done at present. 
Coco-nut Tree Preservation- 
12. The Inspector of Coco-nut trees complains that in too many cases persons 
summoned for infringing the Ordinance are let off with a caution, or fined in so small 
amounts as to be non-deterrent. In view of the increasing importance of Coco nut 
cultivation, and the necessity for keeping the beetle in check, for which it has recent- 
ly been found necessary to take steps in the Federated Malay States on the same 
lines as in the Colony, I think too lenient treatment is a mistake.
