Through the kindness of correspondents in Burma, I have obtained a consider- 
able number of Shan States and other orchids, and although most of them are small 
plants, not quite good enough for sending to Europe, they do very well for the pur- 
pose of finding ouftheir suitability to the climate. 
21. The plant-shed in which palms, ferns and foliage plants generally have for 
some time been grown for decorating the corridor, &c., has been removed to a spot 
alongside the Overseer’s Quarters, where it will be more constantly under his eye, 
and also nearer a water supply in dry weather. 
. Preservation of Coco-nut Trees. 
22. The Inspector of Coco-nut Trees has been employed during alternate 
months in Penang and Province Wellesley. Two thousand six hundred and forty- 
eight notices were served on persons having on their premises dead trees, manure, 
or other material in which beetles breed, calling on them to destroy the same within 
a specified time. For non-compliance, fifty-two were summoned and fined in small 
amounts, aggregating $134. 
When in Province Wellesley, this Officer works under the direction of the Senior 
District Officer, who directs hLe'attention to the localities most needing attention, and 
signs the notices.
