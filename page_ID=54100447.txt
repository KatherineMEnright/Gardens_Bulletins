Botanic Gardens, Penang. 
Waterfall Garden. 
There has been no change in the permanent staff, but Mr. W. Fox was in charge 
from the 1st May to the 31st October during my absence on leave. 
2. Mp. Fox says that owing to exceptionally heavy rains during that time, 
which caused much damage to roads and paths, and several land-slips, nearly all the 
available labour was required in repairing and maintaining the roads and grounds in 
decent order and prevented the carrying out of improvements or extension to any 
great extent. 
3. The most important w T ork of improvement during tl^e year is the reconstruc- 
tion of the Fern Shed in iron. Most of the material for this was purchased out of the, 
1898 Vote and the work of erection carried out by the Garden Overseer and coolies. 
It is a great improvement on the old wooden shed and will be easier and less expen- 
sive to maintain in the future.
