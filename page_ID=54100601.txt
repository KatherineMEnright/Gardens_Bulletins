will be remembered that the Gardens were handed over to the Municipality in 1910 
immediately after the retirement of Mr. Fox. During the intervening period they 
were under the charge of Mohamed Aniff who maintained them in as good a, 
condition as was possible under the circumstances. Their resumption by the Govern- 
ment as Botanical Gardens again will be received with much gratification by the 
numerous botanists and • horticulturists in all parts of the world who constantly 
expressed their regret that these fine and celebrated gardens should be destroyed. 
No Curator has as yet been appointed to take charge. 
Rubber Exhibition. 
A series of specimens were prepared and sent from the Botanic Gardens to the 
Rubber Exhibition held in London in June. 
They included specimens of the trunks of adult trees showing forms of tapping, 
samples of rubber and specimens showing leaves, flowers and fruit, and a case of 
historical specimens, illustrating the development of the industry, and comprising the 
first biscuits, and sheet, and the first tyres made from cultivated rubber. They proved 
a very attractive exhibit at the Show. The Director also attended meetings in 
Kuala Lumpur to arrange about the Planters’ exhibits. 
Bhang. 
There were a number of cases of smuggling of Indian hemp into Singapore 
contrary to regulations, and as usual the Director attended Court on these occasions, 
to identify the drug. 
Government House Domain. 
The Government House grounds and Domain were again, in November, placed 
under the control of the Botanic Gardens Department and steps were taken to get 
them into good condition again as soon as possible. Upwards of two thousand 
ornamental plants and shrubs were supplied by the Botanic Gardens. An additional 
number of Para trees were planted by an extra gang of ten coolies employed for this 
purpose. Repairs were done to the bank of the croquet lawn damaged by the rain, 
and the gully which had become a jungle of weeds was cleaned in part, and planted 
with ornamental plants. A great deal of work will have to be done next year, before 
the grounds are in a fit condition.

Two hundred and fifty-four trees, 95 stumps and 50 heaps of rubbish removed
