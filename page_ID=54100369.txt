n. The result of this trip is, in spite of the unfavourable weather, very satisfac- 
tory. A number of orchid^ and other ornamental plants, about 500 in all,havebeen added 
to the Garden, some of which are undoubtedly new and undescribed. Others are well 
known, but in demand for the purpose of exchange. I also made the acquaintance of 
several gentlemen who will from time to time contribute to the Gardens plants that 
strike them as being of interest, and to whom in return we shall be able to give assist- 
ance in the matter of seeds and plant of economic value. One gentleman, who had 
some experience in growing vanilla in the Seychelles, asked for plants to try m 
Perak, which will be sent him. I was also able to be of some assistance to another 
gentleman in pointing out the first appearance of "Green Bug” on coffee, an insect 
with which they are apparently and fortunately unacquainted in Tapah, and advising 
as to means of checking it at once. « , , „ 
12, This is, I believe, the first time that any member of the Gardens and r orest 
Department of this Settlement has visited Batu Padang or Kijita for the purpose of 
collectino- plants. What is known of the flora is mainly through the collections of 
dried plants made by Mr. Wray and Dr. King's Collector. As neither of these gentle- 
men collected living plants to any extent, I confined my attention principally to this. 
The area explored by me is, of course, very trifling, and it is to be hoped that some 
day an opportunity may occur of extending our knowledge of this region.
