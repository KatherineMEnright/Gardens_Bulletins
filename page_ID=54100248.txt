REPORT OF THE FOREST DEPARTMENT OF SINGAPORE. 
'Area. 
The total area of the Forest Reserves now in Singapore is 14,518 acres, 2 roods, 
23 poles. This gives an increase of 1,553 acres, 1 rood, and 23 poles over that in 
last year’s report. This is due to a revised survey completed this year and to the 
addition of a small patch of good virgin jungle and a little mangrove swamp at 
Toas and Tengek river. 
Boundaries. 
The boundaries are now completed and are kept clear of lalang and fern, and the 
stream and swamps bridged. They have been constantly inspected by myself and 
by the Forest Overseer. 
Forest Watchmen. 
The total number of Forest Watchmen employed was twenty-three ; comprising 
*i Corporal, 5 Lance-Corporals and seventeen men. All worked well, and there were 
no complaints against them. They were supplied with uniforms during the year.
