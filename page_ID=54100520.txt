the case with the fiist shipments, from the East when the loss in washing amounted to

Drying experiments with the aid of Calcium chloride were carried out but this 
could not be fully effected till the drying house was built and dry. 
Tables of results of four experiments were published in the Agricultural Bulletin 
as well as the results of many other observations and experiments, and when all the ex- 
perimental data of these four and two other experiments have been collected 
and tabulated and the rubber collected dried and weighed, a full report on this work 
will be prepared, the results of which will probably be found to be of the first importance. 
Up to the present time 462 lbs. of biscuit rubber has been despatched to London 
tor sale and the balance will be forwarded as soon as dry. 
The greater part of these important experiments was carried out by the Assistant 
Superintendent Mr. R. Derry, who devoted a great deal of his leisure time to this 
work. A Mandore and ten coolies were employed at the work for six months.
