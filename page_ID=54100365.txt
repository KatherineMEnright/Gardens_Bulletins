31. Acting on the principle laid down in paragraph 26, no licenses for cutting 
timber within the reserved areas have yet been issued, although many applications 
have been received, and a rate much higher than that now paid for timber growing 
on Crown land outside the reserves would willingly be paid. All revenue collect- 
ed from Crown forests outside the reserves has been credited to the Land Depart- 
ment, so that without violating one of the first principles laid down at the beginning 
of the work, it has not been possible for the Forest Department to show a revenue. 
This, of course, makes no difference to the actual revenue of the Colony, but it is not 
in accordance with the general rules of forest conservancy.
