in 1 68 classes. The Settlement was very successful and carried off 48 first prizes, 
24 second prizes, 7 third prizes, and 3 exhibits were highly commended. 
Excepting horticulture (plants and flowers) all the large divisions were well 
represented, and while there is a general consensus of opinion as to the educational and 
other advantages of such shows, there does not appear to beany probability of a higher 
or other standard forthcoming. To effect a change in the present practice of 
agriculture I suggest that the best prospect of improvement lies in the encouragement 
and assistance of school gardens as is done in the West Indies and Ceylon. Without 
such early teachfng the market gardener will fail to realize that .quality may be made or 
modified by selection and varied cultivation, and the small coconut planter will proceed 
on the same lines as hitherto, waiting years for a crop instead of being profitably 
engaged in cultivating as catch crops, citronella or lemon-grass oils, improving his 
property and at the same time assisting to build up a large oil industry. A larger 
demand for vegetable oils seems probable and the countries best equipped will be 
naturally the first to reap the benefit. An Agricultural Show would determine whether 
the oil was purer or a vegetable more succulent ; to the observant it would most 
likely indicate the direction' in which improvement might be expected, but first of all 
the methods of agriculture as now practised must be altered, and I cannot conceive 
how such alteration can be effected except in the way suggested.
