. ’ Forest Reserves. 
15. Excepting a part of the unsettled frontier which forms part of a reserve 
boundary between Batang Malaka and Nyalas, the whole of the reserves have now 
been demarcated. 
16. Batang Malaka Reserve. — Owing to my absence on duty in Penang during the 
year 1891, this reserve has remained undemarcated until the present year. The 
work has now been completed, and boundaries extending over four miles have been 
opened at a cost of $35.75. The reserve is entirely hilly; the hills are : — Bukit 
Punggor, 1,303 feet, Bukit Batang Malaka,' 1,419 feet, Bukit Jus, Bukit Bembun, 
1,601 feet, and Bukit Nyalas about 1,200 feet. The Malacca River has its source 
in these hills, as well as several smaller streams. The area of the reserve is approxi- 
mately 3.000 acres, it is well wooded, and I. expect to find some young plants of 
gutta percha, as this district ha£ been famous for its getah trees, and a few young 
plants have been found near the reserve boundary. 
17. Brisu Reserve. — Pending the completion of a survey of this district, it has 
not been possible to complete this reserve earlier. All private rights have now been 
excluded from the reserve, and boundaries extending twelve miles opened at a cost 
of $180.75. 
18. The reserve is divided into two blocks, making a total area of 3,440 acres. 
Several small hills are included within the reserve, the most important are : — Bukit 
Putus, Bukit Jelutong. Bukit Baling, 614 feet, Bukit Senggeh and Bukit Peninjau, 
280 feet. The smaller block is well wooded with mostly Seraya (Hopea cernua), but 
the larger block contains younger jungle. 
19. ' Bukit Bruang Reserve. — A fire broke out amongst the lalang near Ayer 
Keroh, damaging a plantation commenced in 1892, but about seventy per cent, of 
the trees have since revived. The vacancies have been re-filled during the year, and 
the plantation extended. Including the ground re-planted, about twenty acres have 
now been planted at a cost of $355-70.
