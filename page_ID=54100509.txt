lo 
ments throughout India however with the finer long staple cottons like the Sea 
Island variety has been, I regret to say, unsatisfactory. Through the kindness of 
Messrs. Pritchard & Co. a small parcel of Egyptian cotton seed was imported by 
them and distributed to several planters and others. The plants raised from seeds 
supplied us have been planted on one of the Estates in the Province where they will 
have a better chance of showing how far they are adapted for growing in the country, 
than had they been kept in the Gardens. The results will be duly noted. Another 
of our local Planters has determined to give Sea island Cotton an exhaustive trial in 
this country and for this purpose he has asked me to procure for him two Cvvt. of the 
best strain of Sea Island Cotton Seeds. We shall therefore be ill a position to tell 
whether Cotton will be one of the staple cultivations to be added to our list of Agri- 
cultural products introduced from America. 
12. Gutta Percha . — Our seed bearing trees which fruited in 1901, have shown 
no sign of flowering again. 
*13. Coco-nut trees Preservation. 
The number of summonses issued was 103 and lines were recovered to the 
amount of $249.50 as against 44 summonses and $101.50 fines recovered in 1902. A 
sharp look out was kept over the " Roko” (Cigarette paper) makers in the Province, 
a* it was found that the black beetle was particularly fond of depositing its eggs m 
the refuse of the Nipah leaves, which form the outer covering of Rokos. The follow- 
ing Table summarizes the work done during the year. The Expenditure being shown 
in Appendix A. 
14. Expenditure — The total amount of Government Grants under the heading 
of Botanic Gardens amount to $7,000, of which $6,868.27 was expended, particulars 
of which are given in Appendix A annexed.
