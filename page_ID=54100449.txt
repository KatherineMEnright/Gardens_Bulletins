15. As pointed out in my last year’s report there is no further object in spending 
much on this Nursery as it has been proved that it is not high enough for European 
fruits, and for the purpose of experiment with rubbers and such other economic 
products as is likely to be of commercial value, the land is too steep and limited in 
area.

Agricultural Show. 
,8 A most successful Agricultural Show was held at Butterworth, Province 
Wellesley -in June, an account of which was published ,n ^ Government Gazette 
ol August 25th. Altogether there were nine hundred and eighty exhibits and the 
‘“‘“Irr^^’the'GovernorfHni’Bungalovv Garden was exhibited a collection of European 
V 1 ul /ll for romnetition) which received honourable mention. Samples of Para- 
Ve l' ) Ae Wat^Wl Garden also attracted attention. Mr. R. Derrv. 
Superintendent of Government Plantations, Perak, exhibited a splendid collection of 
tuberous Begonias, Pelargoniums, Fuchsias, &c., grown on Maxwell s Hill at an eleva- 
tion of nearly 4,000 feet I am told that from a horticultural point of view this was 
the most interesting feature of the show. It is also a striking example of what a 
few degrees of temperature will do for plains. None of these things can be satisfac- 
torily grown in the plains no matter what pains are taken.
