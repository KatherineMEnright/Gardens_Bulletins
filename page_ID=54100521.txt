Director of Gardens , S. S. 
Botanic Gardens, Penang. 
Staff. 
No change in the Staff took place during the year and all worked well. There 
was a good deal of sickness about the middle of the year chiefly Dengue and Malarial 
fever. The ordinary Malarial fever of which we had a number of cases is said to be 
of a more virulent type in the Gardens than elsewhere in Penang. 
Visitors. 
A number of scientific men called in passing through to Buitenzorg where the 
facilities for studying the Botany of Malaya are unrivalled. Other visitors, especially 
passeno-ers by the German Mails, continue to increase and it is now necessary to have 
a man stationed at the gates to regulate the gharries and 'rikishas and to prevent the 
coolies who linger about the gates annoying people by forcing their company on them 
as guides. There were no thefts except a very flagrant one at the Governor's Hill 
Gardens — where a lady tore down from a tree an Orchid in full flower. She was 
fined $25. 
The Weather. 
2. The weather has been fairly normal, the rainfall was about the average. The 
total fall on the Hill for the year was 134*25 inches as against 123*35 inches on the 
plain. The wettest month was in August, 26'34 inches were registered on the Hill, 
and 26'33 inches on the plain respectively. March was the driest month on the Hill 
with 3*88 inches and .February on the plain where 2*02 inches only were registered. 
The work generally was' of a routine character such as propagating by seeds and 
cuttings the usual Aock of plants kept for decoration and sale. Most of olm* per- 
manent collections of pot plants have been repotted, and the upkeep of Flower beds
