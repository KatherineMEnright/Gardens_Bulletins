lalang is now nearly covered by secondary jungle, the difference in one year being very 
marked. The most useful tree in expelling lalang is the Leban, Vitex pubescens, 
which not only kills it out but also is useful as supplying a good building timber. 
The Tampinis planted here some years ago have grown into trees of considerable size, 
but for want of pruning hjive as usual branched too much to supply good beams at 
present. 
At Bukit Timah about three acres of land at the base of the hill, were cleared of 
scrub, dug and planted with Gutta percha plants. The Bilian trees formerly planted 
here were freed from the overcrowding jungle, and the Merbau and other trees 
cleaned, and dug round, Para-rubber, Tembusu and other trees were planted round in 
suitable places. 
The Para-rubber trees at Bukit Mandai were inspected and the grass cleared 
round them. ' They have made fair growth but have not yet fruited. A special vote 
of 455 dollars was granted for the Bukit Timah and Bukit Mandai planting.

down. The plant-houses were re-attapped, and two iron arches were erected to 
carry plants of 1 pomea Horsfallice.
