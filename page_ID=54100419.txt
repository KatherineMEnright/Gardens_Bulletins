the Eastern boundary and is much choked; this river is, I understand, to be cleared 
next year in connection with the revision of the Muar boundary. I attempted to get 
a “ jalor” for the use of the Guard, but could not obtain a suitable one for the amount 
authorised ; another attempt will be made next year. 
7. Below will be found a tabulated statement of prosecutions for trespass and 
illicit cutting in the Reserves, none of the cases were serious, the object generally 
being to cut Umbai, rattan, etc. ; in most cases more than one man was involved ; —

The total fines paid were' $30.70. 
Before the closing of the Reserves to cutting, the contractor building the New 
Office and Police Station obtained $ 196.50 worth of timber for those buildings from 
the Ayer Panas and Merlimau Reserves and paid $49.13 as royalty. 
8. The timber in places is good, notably at Batang Malaka and Merlimau, 
but in the latter there are numerous traces of illicit cutting which took place during 
the withdrawal of the Guard ; it appears indeed to me that if the Forest Department 
was re-established on its old basis and timber was properly thinned, the cost of the 
establishment could be at all events partly defrayed by the revenue which would be 
obtained.* At present the Forest Ranger has no time to inspect the Reserves 
and the District Officer can only make very occasional, somewhat cursory and lay 
inspections, this has been frequently brought to notice in former reports.

* By such a system as this the Government could obtain good timber, stock it until seasoned and hand 
it over to its contractors. In this way the use of green timber in new buildings would be avoided and the 
durability of the work increased.
