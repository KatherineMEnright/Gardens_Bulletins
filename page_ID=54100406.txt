There was a fire in August in the Chan Chu Kang Reserve where 30 acres of 
lalang and brushwood were burnt. The cause of this fire was discovered and one 
SohKah was summoned for mischief by fire. Case was dismissed owing to in- 
sufficient evidence from witness. The extension of Selctar Reserve was surveyed 
but not calculated. Acreage not known.
