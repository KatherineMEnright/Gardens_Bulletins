Experimental Rubber Tapping. 
The vote of $1,200 for these experiments was renewed this year, and the experi- 
ments were continued. The calcium chloride house was used during the year 
but was not so effective as was hoped, though it certainly aided in quicker drying. 
Sixteen men were employed during the latter part of the year, in tapping and preparing 
the rubber. A large iron pan was purchased for drying the calcium chloride, and a 
brick oven built for heating if. TheTubber sent home last year fetched 6.r. Q\d. and 
6 s. 3 \d. a lb., being the highest market rates at the time. The sum of $2,440 was 
obtained by the sale. The money advanced by the Government was refunded and a 
bonus of $500 was given to the Assistant Superintendent. The remainder was 
paid into an account for carrying on further experiments. A report on the previous 
year’s work was presented to the Legislative Council, and ordered to be published 
which was done in November. Nearly a thousand pounds of rubber was made also 
during the year, which will also be sold in 1906. The result of the experiments made 
during the year will be published as soon as they are completed.
