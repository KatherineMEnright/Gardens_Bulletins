Preservation of Coco-nut Trees. 
1 8. The Inspector of Coco-nut Trees was employed half the year in Penang 
and the other half in Province Wellesley under the direction of the District Officers. 
Two thousand and twenty-one (2,021) notices were served on persons having on their 
premises dead trees or heaps of rubbish likely to prove suitable breeding places for 
beetles, calling on them to destroy the same within a specified time. Sixty- four (64) of 
these persons were summoned for failing to comply, and of this number, 57 were fined 
in small amounts aggregating $99. 
General. 
19. I must again refer to the need of more office space, or a separate building 
for herbarium specimens. The present two rooms are too small for both purposes.
