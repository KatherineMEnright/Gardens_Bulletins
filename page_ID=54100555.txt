collection of Agaricini sent from the Peninsula, are described in the “ Kew Bulletin ” 
and contain a considerable number of new species. 
The whole Herbarium was re-poisoned, a work which occupied four men for four 
months, and used 50 gallons of Methylated Spirits and Corrosive Sublimate. This was 
considered necessary as on one morning it was found that the termites had during the 
night invaded the building and had carried tunnels almost into the cabinets. As there 
are a large number of types and cotypes of different species of plants in the collection 
the loss of which would be irreparable, the assistance of the Public Works Department 
was called in to minimize the risk of the destruction of the building and its more 
valuable contents, by painting the vulnerable parts of the building with Jodelite. 
Publications. 
Three volumes on the Monocotyledons of the Malay Peninsula by the Director 
were published during the year, forming part of the series of the “ Materials^ for a 
Flora of the Malay Peninsula ” which are being published under the direction of 
Sir George King. 
The “ Agricultural Bulletin ” was published monthly as usual. 
Library. 
During the year 76 monthly, five weekly and three quarterly publications of other 
establishments, 158 books, annual reports and pamphlets were received. Nearly all 
these are obtained in exchange for the “ Bulletin ” and Gardens Reports. 
The Agricultural Show. 
This Show was held in Kuala Kangsar this year, and the Superintendent 
Mr. W. Fox represented the Settlement at it. Comparatively few exhibits were sent 
from Singapore.

Inspection of Coconut Trees. 
11 / 
Notices were served on 174 persons but no prosecutions were necessary. Three 
hundred and forty-five trees and forty stumps were destroyed and fifty piles of rubbish 
likely to contain beetles. The beetles can perhaps hardly be stated to be quite extinct 
In the Island, but they have become pretty scarce nowadays and the destruction of 
trees by them now is quite insignificant. Care will have to be taken in the future to 
prevent their return.
