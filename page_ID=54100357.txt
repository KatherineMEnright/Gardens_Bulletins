' Herbarium and Museum. 
15. No botanical tours outside Singapore were taken during the year, never- 
theless a considerable number of Singapore species were added, collected mainly 
by the Director in the ouflying parts of the island. Four hundred and seventy-seven 
(477) specimens were received from Dr. King, Calcutta; 36 from Dr. HAVILAND, 
Borneo; 272 from Malacca; 97 from Baron VON Mueller, Australia; 88 speci- 
mens were collected in Java by Mr. HuLLETT, and 30 from various sources. Many 
plants, chiefly orchids, were sent in to be named by local cultivators. 
16. The following specimens were distributed (many of them for identification 
by various, specialists) : — One thousand four hundred and sixteen (1,416) to Dr. 
King, Calcutta; 1,862 to the British Museum; 452 to the Royal Gardens, Kew ; 101 
palms to Professor O. BECCARI, Naples ; 25 Melastomaceie to Professor COGNIAUX, 
France; 96 species of mosses to Professor BrotheRUS, Russia; 33 species to Dr. 
HAVILAND; 29 ferns to Colonel Beddome, England ; 13 ferns to Bishop HOSE ; 28 
Graminese to United States Department of Agriculture and Professor Hackel, St. 
Polten. Our herbarium of Malayan bamboos was loaned to Mr. Gamble of the India 
Forest Department, who was engaged on a monograph of the Indian species. After 
critical examination, several of ours prove to be new. 
17. The Museum was enriched by a very complete set of Johor timbers to the 
number of 614, and while some uf these, no doubt, will* prove to be duplicates, it is 
nevertheless the most complete set ever got together: they have been cut to a uniform 
size, and will be placed in cabinets for reference. 
18. A series of saprophytes were preserved in spirits, one of them proving new, 
and has been named Thismia fumida. Some plants used by the aborigines of the 
Peninsula for making their arrow poison, were presented by Professor Vaughan 
Stevens. A series of various natural history specimens . were sent to the British 
Museum and to Mr. HolmbS of the Pharmaceutical Society.

19. A successful Flower Show was held in June, under the auspices of the Gar- 
dens Committee, the main feature of which was the very good display of orchids. 
A Bulletin on Sago was prepared during the year, but the press of work at the 
Government- Printing Office prevented its being published within the year, the same 
cause preventing the publication of the Garden Catalogue, drawn up some time ago. 
I hope these will be taken in hand in 1895.
