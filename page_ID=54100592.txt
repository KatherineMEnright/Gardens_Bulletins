6 
samples of latex and rubber treated with formalin, etc., were submitted to various 
analysts for investigation and report. 
The third Annual Report on the experiments of the previous year was published 
and has attracted much notice and been in steady demand by planters. 
In the matter of plant disease, observations on homes which has been troublesome 
in the gardens, Eutypa caulivora and Diplodia and Corticium have been continued. 
A case°of dieback of a young rubber tree due to Eutypa was observed in the gardens, 
the first definite evidence of its attack on living plants. 
A large number of samples of trees attacked by various fungi were sent during 
the year to the Director for report. The fungi were chiefly Diplodia and Corticium , 
the former mostly from the Malay States, the latter from Borneo. Corticium seems 
to be more injurious in Java and Borneo than it is in the Federated Malay States. 
Other plants. — The chief demand has been for shade and fruit trees and trees for 
windbelts, about 1,000 having been sent out. There has been an increasing demand 
for seed and plants of fruit trees but there has been some trouble in getting these at a 
reasonable rate owing to the poverty of the fruit crops for the last few years. The ^ 
wild mania among natives in Singapore for planting rubber in every corner seen-s to 
have produced a great falling off in the supply of fruit, vegetables, poultiy and even 
pigs, all being neglected or abolished to make way for Para rubber. It is highly 
desirable that the cultivation of fruit trees, neglected for some years, be encouraged. 
There has been a considerable demand *dso for Leguminous cover crops, for green 
soiling and Passiflova foetid a seed ; also a small demand for Coca for hedging in 
estates and chocolate for New Guinea. 
The largest demand for miscellaneous economic plants has been from Formosa 
where the Japanese have begun to start systematic tropical agriculture. Seeds of 
Brucea sumatrana have been sent from time to time to London for experiment and 
investigation. 
Outside work.— A plot of ground at Goodwood Estate measuring seven-and-a- 
half acres was cleared, drained, fenced and planted with five hundred and seventy 
trees of Para rubber. 
A plot of reclaimed land below Mount Zion also seven-and-a-half acres in extent 
was cleared and planted with 810 coconuts. 
The rubber from the trees in Government House park was smoked and finished 
off and sold for the benefit of the Government House funds.
