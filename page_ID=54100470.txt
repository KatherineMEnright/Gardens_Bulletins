Appendix B. 
Botanic Gardens, 
Penang 28th, February 1901. 
Sir, — Jij accordance with your instructions, I went to the Din dings on the 15th 
instant, and inspected the two blocks of Forest it is proposed to add to the Reserves, 
f also took the opportunity of seeing as much as I could in the time of the already 
demarcated areas which are practically those I had the honour of suggesting in 1888, 
and in which no cutting of any importance has been authorized since that time. 
2. From the papers you sent me to see I gather that there is an impression 
that Mr. Canti.EV at some time visited this District and made certain suggestions, 
but I think this is a mistake. I have no recollection of his having been there 
subsequent to my joining the service in 1884, and 1 am pretty sure that he had not 
previously done so. 
3. The present Reserves consist of six blocks, vis : — Pangkore Island, Lumut 
Hills^ Tanjong Hantu. Bukit Segari, Gunong Tunggal, and Tanjong Burong. The 
latter is all mangrove and is reserved specially for fire wood. 
4. The two portions that it is now proposed to add are several miles apart, one 
being in the extreme North of the District, and the other in the extreme South. The 
District Officer proposes that these should be known as Ulu Bruas, and Fulloh Morah 
Reserves. 
5. Ulu Bruas Reserve is a triangular block of forest land, mainly hilly, but in- 
cluding some low wet jungle, which has been recent]}' worked by timber cutters. The 
boundaries on Two sides are well defined by the territorial boundary line which divides 
Perak and the Dindings, and the third by a cart-road fora distance of about two-and- 
a-half miles. A good deal of land has been taken up along the edge of this road for 
cultivation so that in places the 1 road will not be the actual boundary but a line run- 
ning more or less parallel with it above the line of cultivation. It is difficult to esti- 
mate the area with anything like correctness but it is safe to say that the area is not 
less than 1.500 acres. This Reserve contains the only Gutta Percha (Gutta Taban) 
I saw in the District. I actually saw only half-a-dozen trees but 1 have no doubt there 
are many more. The largest measured had a girt of 5' 6" at five feet from the 
ground.
