It is gratifying to note that far the larger portion of these seeds have gone to various 
parts of the British Empire, and only comparatively few to other countries. 
Other Plants Exported. 
Ficus elastica is less in demand, and only 510 plants were exported this year to Sydney. 
A large number of seeds were exported to Southern Nigeria, 1,000 Coconuts were purchased 
and packed and transmitted there, and several bags of Nipa seeds and of Sago seed. These 
are reported to have arrived in good condition. Mangosteen and Durian seed were also 
sent. The latter is especially a bad traveller, as the seed is very fleshy and soon spoils. 
Experiments on Rubber Tapping. 
16 . — A series of experiments were carried out through the year to test the effect of 
tapping at all seasons of the year, and a special and full report was sent to the Government 
on the result. There was a vote of $ 1,200 allowed for these experiments, which 
actually cost $1,178.50. This vote was refunded to the Government from the money received 
by the sale of the rubber made during the experiments, which amounted to $2,600.41, so 
that the experiments cost the Colony nothing at all. A quantity of Latex was supplied to 
the Agricultural Exhibition to make into Crepe with a Crepe Machine, and a quantity of 
rubber in different forms sent to the Exhibition iti Ceylon. 
Inspection of Coconut Trees. 
17* — Notices were served on 192 persons during the year, and 720 dead trees, 294 
stumps, and 60 piles of rubbish likely to harbour beetles or already containing them were 
destroyed. There were no prosecutions.

The following details of Revenue and Expenditure are appended. It is noticeable that 
there is a balance of $1,875.74 at tlie end of the year, which requires explanation. The 
annual vote supplied by the Government is not adequate for the expenses of the Gardens 
and one-third of the cost is made on sales, and, as the money for the sales does not come in 
till late in the year, it is essential to keep a strong balance for the early part of the following 
year. &
